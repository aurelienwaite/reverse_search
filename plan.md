# Reverse search implementation

## Plan

1. Implement essential vertices
2. Implement adjacency
3. Test against cube and cross
4. Test against thesis data
5. Implement reverse search
6. Test with cube and cross
7. Test with thesis data

# Update 21/05/2024

* A massive search space, even for small sets
* For this search to be feasible, we need someway to prune the search space

## Plan

1. Design a tree search
2. Implement tree search
3. Perhaps use a reinforcement learning technique - Q function?
3. Free cloud VM from oracle
